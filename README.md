# Scapy-Tester

In this repository there are codes to send and receive scapy packets across a network. There is the IPv4 version as well as the IPv6 version. The final product should be a list of the ports and IP address of the packets that were received. To execute the code, replace the IP addresses on the sender and receiver accordingly. Then make change the port range on the sender and change the last port on the listener to reflect the sender. Run the listener first and wait a few seconds before running the sender.
